A meeting of Consulta was held on Microsoft Teams on 2023/05/16

Attendees:
	- Asher Radowsky
	- Liad Peretz
	- Josh Shapiro
	- Elli Joffe

Sprint 2 velocity: 25 points across 6 stories (7 dev sized stories delivered out of 8)

Activities performed well:

- Splitting up of coding tasks amongst devs
- Timeous completion of coding activities
- Azure pipelined smoothly
- Trunk integrity maintained well
- Code pull request format finilised (branches)

Activities performed suboptimally:

- Completed all but one user story
- Timeous uploading of completed code to GitHub
- Review tasks split up effectively


Improvements to be made:

- Ensure all user stories are complete in next sprint
- Push code to repo as story is completed
- Make it clear before review phase exactly who is reviewing whom
