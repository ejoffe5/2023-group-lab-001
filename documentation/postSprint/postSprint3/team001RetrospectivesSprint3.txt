A meeting of Consulta was held on Microsoft Teams on 2023/05/23

Attendees:
	- Asher Radowsky
	- Liad Peretz
	- Josh Shapiro
	- Elli Joffe

Sprint 3 velocity: 25 points across 6 stories (9 dev sized stories delivered out of 9)

Activities performed well:

- Splitting up of coding tasks amongst devs
- Timeous completion of coding activities
- Trunk integrity maintained well
- Code review process well organized and completed
- All user stories delivered

Activities performed suboptimally:

- Some merge conflicts
- More testing can be done

Improvements to be made:

- Implement a little more testing as code is written

LARGE DESIGN CHOICE MADE:

- Event table in database is restructured such that each event can only exist on one day of the week (including recurring weeks).
 This is done to simplify the booking process, as well as to make the editing and displaying of event bookings more straightforward. Code
 which deals with this table was updated timeously such that the trunk integrity was maintained.
