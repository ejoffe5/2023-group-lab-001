Attendees:

Sprint 1 velocity: 8 (dev sized stories)

Activities performed well:

- Splitting up of tasks amongst devs
- Timeous completion of coding activities
- Achieved all sprint targets (including non-user stories)
- Delivered all user stories

Activities performed suboptimally:

- Timeous uploading of completed code to GitHub
- Issues encountered in the setting up of the Azure deployment which lead to delays
- Best practice of completing pull requests was undecided (forks vs branches)

Improvements to be made:

- Push code to repo as story is completed
- Standardise method of completing pull requests
- Streamline Azure deployment
